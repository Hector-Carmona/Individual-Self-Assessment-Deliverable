# Individual-Self-Assessment-Deliverable

## Module 20 Individual Self Assessment Deliverable

For the project we have worked as a team, in which each individual skills has made up for the skill of other teammates.

With the skills gained through all the bootcamp, we were able to appy them from:
 - Data extraction from csv file, using Pandas
 - Clean up of the data, in which null cells values were left aside from the data in order to carry out the analysis.
 - Data transformation, in which type of value were changed so we can used the data for the analysis creating new tables for the data.
 - Database Mockup, we crated a sketch so we could obtained visual aid on how our analysis had to be done and the results that we were looking for.
 - Table Creation & Query Junction using SQL database, in order to gather the data that was going to be analyzed in just one database foR cardiovascular modelation
 - Cardiovascular Modelation was carried out where we made some prediction from the data information in which we got the variables which have the most impact in the cardiovascular diseases
 - Every step of the data analysis has led us to glean that the variables that have the most impact in cardiovascular disease sorted from high importance to low are:
```
        Systolic Blood Pressure
        Body Mass Index (BMI)
        Cholesterol
        Cardio
```

As a team we were able to back each other up in every step of the analysis.
